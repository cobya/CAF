This program is designed to emulate the games Cards Against Humanity, currently known as Cards Against Formatting. It will take input from a file of input cards and a file of input strings. Cards will be processed to match a string of a given length to the card as a way to fill in the blanks. The processed cards are written to a specified output file.
